This project supports the calculation of service areas based on streetnetworks with different Shortest-Path-Algorithms. 

The following Algorithms can be used:
  - Naive Dijkstra
  - Simple Implementation of Dijkstra with Buckets
  - Two_Q (Graph Growth algorithm of Pallotino with two Queues)
  - SBB (Streetbased Buffer) - Development of Buffer method


The file Einzugsgebiet.py is the main Programm, where the graph is build out of the given streetnetwork and the Service Area is created
For parameters you can give impedance of the service area in meters, chosen algorithm and number of firestation of which you want to create service area

A few test cases are given at the end of Einzugsgebiet.py
